# Driver Chap iOS

To run the project you need to have **CocoaPods** installed on your system, since it's the dependency manager used for the project.

To install CocoaPods:

```sudo gem install Cocoapods```

After this, inside the project folder (where Podfile is located) run:

```pod install```

This will install or update all required dependencies.

Use **DriverChap.xcworkspace** to open the project not ~~driverChap.xcodeproj~~
