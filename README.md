## Project Description

Giving people parental control over the car for their children without invading the privacy of the youngsters

## How to build and run the project.

The app is made out of 4 main parts:

1. [Frontend](https://github.com/Smotko/MOCKPIXEL015/blob/master/dashboard)
2. [Backend](https://github.com/Smotko/MOCKPIXEL015/blob/master/backend)
3. [iOS](https://github.com/Smotko/MOCKPIXEL015/tree/master/iOS/driverChap)
4. [Android app](https://github.com/Smotko/MOCKPIXEL015/tree/master/Android/DriverChap)

Each comes with it's own build instructions, sorry that we can't provide
a single script to run all of them at once üò•

## Improvements and other ideas

Our main goal was to give the parents confidence that their children (and also the car) are safe and sound. One of the best improvements would be to be able to show
a big green status saying that everything is OK (the car is inside the geofence, the car did not go over the speed limit, there were no flat tires, no damage to the car, ...).

Another improvement would be to provide actionable notifications to the parents when things do go wrong (automatically text the child when the car leaves the geofence, provide option to call road assistence when a flat tire is detected, etc).

TODO List:
set_lock_time/ get_lock_time: Setting a timer for car use (requires an event in API vehicle)
set_speed: Set a speed limit to the car
set_miles: Set monthly mileage use
